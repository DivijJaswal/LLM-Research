INTERNATIONAL CRICKET COUNCIL 
CODE OF CONDUCT FOR PLAYERS 
AND PLAYER SUPPORT PERSONNEL 

INTRODUCTION 

The ICC is the international federation responsible for the global governance of the sport of cricket and the Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel (the “Code of Conduct”) is adopted and implemented as part of the ICC’s continuing efforts to maintain the public image, popularity and integrity of cricket by providing: (a) an effective means to deter any participant from conducting themselves improperly on and off the field-of-play or in a manner that is contrary to the Spirit of Cricket; and (b) a robust and proportionate disciplinary procedure pursuant to which all matters of improper conduct can be dealt with fairly, with certainty and in an expeditious manner. 

ARTICLE 1 SCOPE AND APPLICATION



All Players and Player Support Personnel are automatically bound by and required to comply with all of the provisions of the Code of Conduct. Accordingly, by their participation (in the case of a Player) or assistance in a Player’s participation (in the case of a Player Support Personnel) in an International Match, such Players or Player Support Personnel shall be deemed to have agreed: 

that it is their personal responsibility to familiarise themselves with all of the requirements of the Code of Conduct, including what conduct constitutes an offence under the Code of Conduct; 

to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of any Match Referee, Judicial Commissioner or Appeal Panel convened under the Code of Conduct to hear and determine charges brought (and any appeals in relation thereto) pursuant to the Code of Conduct; and

not to bring any proceedings in any court or other forum that are inconsistent with the foregoing submission to the jurisdiction of the Match Referee, Judicial Commissioner or Appeal Panel.


 All Players and Player Support Personnel shall continue to be bound by and required to comply with the Code of Conduct until he/she has not participated (in the case of a Player), or assisted a Player’s participation (in the case of a Player Support Personnel) in an International Match for a period of three (3) months from the date of his/her last participation and the ICC shall continue to have jurisdiction over him/her under the Code of Conduct thereafter in respect of matters taking place prior to that point. 
Without prejudice to Articles 1.1 and 1.2, the ICC and the National Cricket Federations shall be responsible for promoting Code of Conduct awareness and education amongst all Players and Player Support Personnel. 

It is acknowledged that certain Players and Player Support Personnel may also be subject to other rules of National Cricket Federations that govern discipline and/or conduct, and that the same conduct of such Players and/or Player Support Personnel may implicate not only the Code of Conduct but also such other rules that may apply. For the avoidance of any doubt, Players and Player Support Personnel acknowledge and agree that: (a) the Code of Conduct is not intended to limit the responsibilities of any Player or Player Support Personnel under such other rules; and (b) nothing in such other rules shall be capable of removing, superseding or amending in any way the jurisdiction of the Match Referee, Judicial Commissioner or Appeal Panel to determine matters properly arising pursuant to the Code of Conduct. 

For the avoidance of any doubt: 

 all Umpires and Match Referees officiating in any International Matches are automatically bound by and required to comply with all of the provisions of the ICC Code of Conduct for Match Officials and Match Official Support Personnel; and 1.5.2 where a representative side of a National Cricket Federation participates in an International Tour Match against a domestic or invitational team, for the purposes of their participation in such International Tour Match: 

 all Players and Player Support Personnel representing the National Cricket Federation’s representative side are automatically bound by, required to comply with, and shall submit themselves to the jurisdiction of this Code of Conduct; and 

 all players or player support personnel representing the domestic or invitational team shall not be bound by this Code of Conduct. Instead, such individuals will be bound by, required to comply with, and shall submit themselves to the jurisdiction of the relevant National Cricket Federation’s own applicable rules of conduct
